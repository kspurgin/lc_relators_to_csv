# LcRelatorsToCsv

To generate CSVs:

- download the n-triples (nt) version of the Relators vocabualary from https://id.loc.gov/download/
- update the path to that file in the definition of `graph` in `lib/lc_relators_to_csv.rb`
- run `bin/console`

This is still janky and you have to exit out of console manually,  but it works.
